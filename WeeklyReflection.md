# Weekly Reflection


### Week 2 (Started Sept 9)

Wrote an elevator pitch
Created a repository on GitHub and completed some basic project setup work - created in IntelliJ, made files for plan
Sketched screen design with pen/paper

I was a bit distracted this weekend by lots and lots of housework and did the bare minimum to stay "on track."

### Week 3 (Started Sept 16)

Filled out my project plan
Brainstormed APIs to use, but didn't do any research
Created screen design and identified which parts are the MVP (aka, basically, the entire thing)

Unfortunately another week of traveling. This week was my big test of whether I can get all my work done without using weekends. Test failed, I need to work on weekends!! I had scheduled a weekend on lake Michigan a few months ago with an old friend who is mega chatty and wanted to unplug from research. Also did lots of driving.
I decided to make my screen design in Google Slides because the lack of "technology" makes it easier for me to do exactly what I want and I am really comfortable with the tools. 
I wanted to focus as much as possible on how someone moves around the site.
I am happy with my site structure--I think I did a good job keeping it simple--but nervous about APIs. Possibilities:
*https://www.dropzonejs.com/
*Not really an API, but just a technology: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API/File_drag_and_drop
